# amonet-biscuit

This is a fork of the original amonont exploit chain, documented [here](https://github.com/xyzz/amonet). 

This fork was created to document how to root the Echo Dot v2
(biscuit). It also has been re-organized to allow the BROM exploit to
be used as a mini-shell for read/write of eMMC and memory.
